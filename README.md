# Inflation-Rates

Find some data on a topic in which you are interested or from which you can produce some interesting visualisations. For example, you could find weather data, pollution data, fantasy football data. 
Create a database from these data â€“ note this might include processing the raw text data, creating tables and inserting the data into these tables.
List four or five questions you would like the data to answer. For example, if we were using weather data, one question might be 'What is the wettest day of the year and where was it?' or 'What was the wettest day in Bath?' Similarly, if we were using a fantasy football dataset, the question might be 'Which player scored the most goals and made the most assists?'
Produce a series of visualisations to answer these questions. Numpy is a good visualisation API in Python but you are free to research and use other APIs.
